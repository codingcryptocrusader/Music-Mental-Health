A small amount of \"jitter\" was added to the data points to prevent overplotting where many respondents have the same values (e.g., 2 hours, depression score of 7).

    "Finding: The regression line has a slight positive slope, suggesting a weak positive correlation: as listening hours increase, the depression score tends to increase slightly. However, the points are widely dispersed, indicating that this relationship is not strong. There are many people who listen for many hours with low depression scores, etc. This tells us that listening time alone is not a strong predictor of depression.\n",

For each condition, the box plot clearly shows the median (the line inside the box), the interquartile range (the box itself, representing the middle 50% of data), and the spread of the data (the whiskers). This makes it easy to compare, whether the median anxiety score is higher than the median insomnia score and how their spreads differ.
